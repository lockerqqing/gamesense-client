#### Credits
Check specific class files for full credits.
This client started out based off of IUDevman GameSense, which in turn was based off of Osiris. 
Without these projects, Vulu would not exist so a lot of credit is due to them for their work.

This client also implements the ClickGUI using PanelStudio: https://github.com/lukflug/PanelStudio/.
If you believe that we are using your code and credits are not properly given, please message GooberTown#7384 on Discord.
